# TapWars
TapWars is a light-saber dueling game inspired by the Star Wars series. You can fight with your friends to gain fame and lots of fun. Our game involves two players: red and green (Dark Side vs Light Side). When a player taps his part of the screen it will grow a bit in size and when one player overpowers the other (his part covers the game board) sheâ€™ll win the round.
